# Tethered-UAV-control
A MATLAB/Simulink implementation of the tethered UAV control problem under the taut cable condition. <br />
This is an implementation of paper titled ["Nonlinear control of a tethered UAV: The taut cable case"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00348), by M. Nicotra et.at. (2017). <br />
All equations can be found in the referenced paper.

# Prerequisites
MATLAB/Simulink software.

# How to use
1- Download the files. <br />
2- double click "TetheredUAVControl.prj" to open it in the MATLAB/Simulink environment (Now the parameters will be loaded and the emplementation in Simulink will pop-up). <br />
3- Run the simulink model to plot the results. <br />
4- Edit the MATLAB script "UAV_Taut_Cable_parameters.m" for your desiered scenario and parameters.
