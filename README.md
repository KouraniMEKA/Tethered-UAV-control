# Tethered-UAV-control
A MATLAB/Simulink implementation of the tethered UAV control problem under the taut cable condition.
This is an implementation of paper titled "Nonlinear control of a tethered UAV: The taut cable case", by [M. Nicotra et.at.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308823858_Nonlinear_Control_of_a_Tethered_UAV_the_Taut_Cable_case) (2017).
All equations can be found in the referenced paper.
